## Factory

Factory is a creational design pattern. You create interface for creating an object and then inherit this interface in different classes and show how actually the objects are created
In this project it is used for cafes: there is a interface for the cafes which shows that a cafe can make late, mochacinno and regualar coffee.
This inteface is inherited by 3 types of real cafes that make their coffeee using different ingredients.
