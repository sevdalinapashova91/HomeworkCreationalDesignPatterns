## Singleton
Singleton is a creational pattern designed to create a unique istance of a object in the program.
This is easily accomplished by using static instance of the class in it self that is created the first time the class is used.
There is a problem when there are multiple treads. That is why double locking of the instance is required.
In this project there is provided example for singleton that represent unique id generator.
